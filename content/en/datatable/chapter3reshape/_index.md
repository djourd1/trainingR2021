For the analysis of choice experiment data, we have to store the repeated choices of respondents. You can store repeated information in two broad types of format: the wide and the long format. 

In this section you will learn: 


+ [What are the wide and long formats?](#wide-or-long-format)
+ [How to reshape date from wide to long format?](#from-wide-to-long-format)
+ [How to reshape date from long to wide format?](#from-long-to-wide-format)
