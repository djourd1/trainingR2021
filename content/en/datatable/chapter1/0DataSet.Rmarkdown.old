In this chapter, you will work with the datasets made available by the package gapminder.
You should now be able to install the package on your own. 

Load the `gapminder` package:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
```

If everyting went ok you should be able to access the gapminder data directly
```{r, echo=TRUE}
gapminder
```

We are ready to work on the data.
