Once R Studio IDE is installed, the best way to discover R Studio is to follow the first 20 minutes of the introductory video [Programming - Part 1 (Writing code in RStudio)](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/programming-part-1-writing-code-in-rstudio/) developed by R Studio.

The video presents the different components of the IDE, and how to make the best use of it.
