One important thing you will have to understand is the difference between R and RStudio. R is an open source computer software that will crunch numbers for you. R Studio is a company who developed an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that will make your life easier when using R. It is called R Studio IDE. To follow this class, you will need to install both R and R Studio. 

We will first make sure that you can write simple instruction using the R software. Then we will install R Studio IDE. After installing R Studio IDE, the R software will run in the background.

At the end of this session, you will have installed both R and R Studio IDE, and you will be able to:

+ run interactive sessions with R or R Studio IDE
+ save your work into scripts for further reuse
+ load some specialized codes written by other researchers and bundled into specialized packages.
