This Chapter will help install the necessary softwares, R and R Studio. 

One important thing you will have to understand is the difference between R and RStudio. R is an open source computer software that will crunch numbers for you. R Studio is a company who developed an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that will make your life easier when using R. It is called R Studio IDE. To follow this class, you will need to install both R and R Studio.
